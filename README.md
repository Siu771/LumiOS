## Contributing

Lumi OS is now **open-source**!  
Games have moved to a separate repository: [lumi-games](https://github.com/LuminesenceProject/lumi-games)

> When adding games, please ensure you include an **image preview**.

To get the source code, click the dropdown on main, then the version you want.
Unfortunately old versions were lost since the code was directly updated.
The code between major updates was completely changed. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Some feature suggestions may not be added — especially ones relying on external servers — to keep **offline functionality** intact.  
> Game links can always be updated through the **Settings** app.

**Contributors** will be credited in this repository.

## Issues & Support

To report an issue, visit the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/LuminesenceProject/LumiOS/issues) and click **New Issue**.  
You can also chat with us and submit bugs on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TyacaNY3GK)!

### Common Issues & Fixes

- **White Screen Error:**  
  This is a known issue. To fix it, type `"lumiplus"` (exact spelling) — this will **clear all local data** and reset the system.  
  Works on version 4.2 and above, *except for v11*, where you must redownload the latest version.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Type `"lumiplus"` in that exact order to trigger the system reset popup.

If possible, provide a screenshot or copy the error message when reporting.
